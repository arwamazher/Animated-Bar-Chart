# Animated-Bar-Chart
This project creates an animated bar chart based on the file selected to display categorical data.

Each bar aggregates related information (name, value, and category) for use in a bar chart.

A bar chart stores an entire frame of the animation inside an array of Bar objects

An array of barcharts are then created and frames are added to it.
